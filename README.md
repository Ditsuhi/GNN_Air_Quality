# Graph neural network for air quality prediction: a case study in Madrid

## Air quality monitoring, modeling and forecasting are considered pressing and challenging topics for both citizens and decision-makers, including the government. The tools used to achieve the above goals vary depending on the opportunities provided by technological development. Much attention is currently being paid to machine learning and deep learning methods, which, compared to domain knowledge methods, often perform better in terms of collecting multidimensional information. The technique introduced in the ongoing work is one of the most advanced methods, an attention temporal graph convolutional network, which was implemented on datasets constructed by combining air quality, meteorological and traffic data on a spatiotemporal axis. The datasets were obtained from the city of Madrid for the periods January-June 2019 and January-June 2020. The evaluation metrics, the Root Mean Square Error, the Mean Absolute Error and Pearson correlation coefficient confirmed the proposed model's advantages compared with Long Short-Term Memory (reference model). Particularly, it outperformed the latter method by 14.18% and 3.78\%, respectively.
